        <h2>BEAUTY</h2>
    </div>
    <p>“Beautiful things grow to a certain height and then they fail and fade off, breathing out memories as they decay. And just as any period decays in our minds, the things of that period should decay too, and in that way they’re preserved for a while in the few hearts like mine that react to them.” – Fitzgerald, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i></p>
    <p>"Nichts in der Welt war so weiss wie dein Leib // Nichts in der Welt war so schwarz wie dein Haar // In der ganzen Welt war nichts so rot wie dein Mund" (No thing on Earth was as white as thy skin // No thing on Earth was so black as thy hair // And in all the world was no thing so red as thy mouth) - (Salome) Strauss, <i>Salome</i></p>

    </div>
    <p>"O bridal night! O sweet night of love! Destiny binds me to you for ever. O sheer delight in living, O all-powerful charms! Your gentle gaze fills me with rapture, your voice ravishes my senses! Beneath your ardent kisses, Heaven is radiant within me. I have given you my heart; it is yours forever. O sheer delight in living, o all-powerful charms, O bridal night!" - (Juliette) Barbier, <i>Romeo et Juliette,​ Act IV Scene I</i></p>
    <p>"If mighty death stood before me threatening the very life in my body which I would so gladly leave for love, how could it reach love itself?" - (Tristan) Wagner, <i>Tristan und Isolde, Act II Scene II</i></p>
    <p>"I do love nothing in the world so well as you - is not that strange?" - Benedick (Shakespeare), <i>Much Ado About Nothing, Act IV Scene I</i></p>
    <p>"Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all; // What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? // No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; // All mine was thine before thou hadst this more." - Shakespeare, <i>Sonnet XL</i></p>
    <p>"I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant." - (Captain Wentworth) Austen, <i>Persuasion</i></p>




    <div id="side-regret">
        <h2>REGRET</h2>
    </div>
        <p>"How bold one gets when one is sure of being loved!" - Freud</p>
        <p>"This time I must look at her more closely than ever. There are certain things about her I already forget. At times I think it is at least a hundred years since I last saw her. And I have still not seen my eyes reflected in hers… If I leave like that I’ll have nothing to keep. And all these memories – it is as if I were carrying water in a sack of muslin. I must look on her one last time to the depths of her heart. I must say to her everything I’ve never said." - (Pelléas) Maeterlinck, <i>Pelléas et Melisande, Act IV Scene IV</i></p>
        <p>"That's why I'm not talking right now about some girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago and how I always regretted not going over and talking to her." - Sean, <i>Good Will Hunting</i></p>
        <p>"Life would have been quite another matter for them both if they had learned in time that it was easier to avoid great matrimonial catastrophes than trivial everyday miseries. But if they had learned anything together, it was that wisdom comes to us when it can no longer do any good." - Marquez, <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i></p>



    <div id="side-desire">
        <h2>DESIRE</h2>
    </div>
    <p>"I was always hungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it -- to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more. Just once." - (Midori) Murakami, <i>Norwegian Wood</i></p>
    <p>“The human heart is like a night bird silently waiting for something, and when the time comes, it flies straight toward it” – Murakami, <i>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</i></p>
    <p>"Like one sees the blades // Of wheat that wave // In the light wind, // So trembles my heart, // Ready to be consoled, // By your voice that is so dear to me!" - (Delilah) Lemaire, <i>Samson et Delilah,​ Act II Scene III</i></p>
    <p>"He allowed himself to be swayed by his conviction that human beings are not born once and for all on the day their mothers give birth to them, but that life obliges them over and over again to give birth to themselves." - Marquez, <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i></p>
    
    <div id="side-twoness">
        <h2>TWONESS</h2>
    </div>
    <p>"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?" - Ecclesiastes 4:9-11, <i>Holy Bible (NIV)</i></p>
    <p>"Spiritual love from the waist up and physical love from the waist down." - (Sara Noriega) Marquez, <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i></p>
    <p>"He had taught her that nothing one does in bed is immoral if it helps to perpetuate love." - Marquez, <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i></p>
    <p>"They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered." - Fitzgerald, <i>This Side of Paradise</i></p>
    <p>"Giving is more joyous than receiving, not because it is a deprivation, but because in the act of giving lies the expression of my aliveness." - Fromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i></p>




    <div id="side-pain">
        <h2>PAIN</h2>
    </div>
        <p>"The man had had the hardest blow of his life. He knew at last what he wanted, but in finding it out it seemed that had put it forever beyond his grasp." - Fitzgerald, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i></p>
        <p>"She reminded him that the weak would never enter the kingdom of love, which is a harsh and ungenerous kingdom, and that women give themselves only to men of resolute spirit, who provide the security they need in order to face life." - Marquez, <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i></p>
        <p>"The man had had the hardest blow of his life. He knew at last what he wanted, but in finding it out it seemed that had put it forever beyond his grasp." - <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, Fitzgerald</p>
        <p>"A clock has always struck me as something ridiculous, a thoroughly mendacious object, perhaps because I have always resisted the power of time out of some internal compulsion which I myself have never understood, keeping myself apart from so-called current events in the hope, as I now think, said Austerlitz, that time will not pass away, has not passed away, that I can turn back and go behind it, and there I shall find everything as it once was, or more precisely I shall find that all moments of time have co-existed simultaneously, in which case non of what history tells us would be true, past events have not yet occurred but are waiting to do so at the moment when we think of them, although that, of course, opens up the bleak prospect of everlasting misery and neverending anguish." - Austerlitz, <i>Austerlitz</i></p>
        <p>"Love is a stove that burns too much." - (Rodolfo) Illica, <i>La Boheme, Act I Scene I</i></p>
        <p>“Jealousy was not a place he was forced into by someone else, but a jail in which the inmate entered voluntarily, locked the door, and threw away the key.  The prison was, after all, his own heart” - Murakami, <i>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</i></p>
        <p>“Suffering and pain are always obligatory for a broad consciousness and a deep heart.  Truly great men, I think, must feel great sorrow in this world” – Dostoevsky, <i>Crime and Punishment</i></p>
